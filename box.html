                    <p>By using digital engagement we can track and reward physical shopping behaviour that currently leaves no data trace</p>

                    <h5>Frictionless User Experience</h5>
                    <p>Unlike traditional loyalty programs that require physical cards or complex sign-ups at the counter, our solution offers "instant gratification" with cashback sent directly to a mobile wallet</p>

                    <h5>Zero Behavior Change</h5>
                    <p>While a bank app only rewards its own users, Yeamazing will reward everyone, making it more inclusive for the 18-35 tech-savvy demographic</p>

                    <h5>Strategic Constraints as Moats</h5>
                    <p>By staying away from being a bank app, a delivery service, or an online marketplace, we avoid the high-burn competition of those sectors and dominate the "offline blindspot"</p>
